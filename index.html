          In terms of functionality, the SAROS 3000 is almost identical to an oxygen cylinder, but is safer, easier to transport and more technologically advanced. Whereas the oxygen cylinder stores compressed oxygen, the SAROS 3000 allows you to pump oxygen directly from the environment. This reduces the explosion hazard of the design and allows it to be used much longer, not to mention the fact that the classic oxygen cylinder is much heavier.

      In the event that a soldier enters an area with unbreathable air, this unit will significantly increase his chances of survival. Most importantly, however, the use of the SAROS 3000 increases the survival rate of wounded soldiers by an average of 500 percent. One of the main reasons soldiers die before receiving first aid is blood loss. The main job of blood is to move oxygen through the body. Oxygen is exactly what the SAROS 3000 can provide the wounded soldier with in sufficient quantity, significantly increasing his chance of survival.
